# Contributing / Reusing

This is just my personal playground. I think any contribution should go to the 
main repository. Having said that, if you have contributions specifically to
the graph layout part: Send me a pull request.

Also, in general, feel free to take any part of this and use it in any way
consistent with the [license](LICENSE.md).
